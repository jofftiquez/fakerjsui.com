  <p>
    These Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") govern your
    relationship with www.parmazip.com website and Parmazip mobile application
    (the "Service") operated by Team O.P.S. Inc. - Philippines ("us", "we", or
    "our").
  </p>
  <p>
    Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before using the Parmazip
    Website and Parmazip mobile application (the "Service").
  </p>
  <p>
    Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of
    and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users
    and others who access or use the Service.
  </p>
  <p>
    By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If
    you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.
  </p>
  <b>Character, Trust and Integrity</b>
  <p>
    Parmazip values Character, Trust, and Integrity. These are values very
    important to the Founders, thus were brought about and integrated in
    Parmazip's Culture.
  </p>
  <p>TRUST AND INTEGRITY</p>
  <p>
    We are looking forward to your entrusting to Parmazip your personal data. We
    know how important this is to you. Our tech team has established standard
    security protocols (and more) to keep your data safe. But does this mean we
    are 100% hack-proof? Well, we want to be. But let's admit it, even the
    world's biggest banks and government institutions are not. Rest assured,
    however, that we have set up our backend infrastructure to protect your data
    and continue to work on it constantly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Personal data like name, photos, phone numbers and email address are yours
    and yours alone. We are committed to not selling these types of data to
    third parties. By availing of the Service, you allow the pharmacist you are
    interacting with access to your name and contact number in order to
    accomplish your orders. We also hope you understand your medicine purchase
    history, records like diseases, types of medicine used, general location and
    anything that would help medical practitioners for research purposes and
    other endeavors that will make better medical decisions - as long as it does
    not directly identify you - could possibly be shared to make our world a
    better place.
  </p>
  <p>CHARACTER</p>
  <p>

    Should you have an idea or want to improve our services, please feel free to

    what we mean) Parmazip's website or its apps. Let us respect each other's
    space, please, thank you!
  </p>
  <p>

    means of placing orders, the customer may contact the Partner Drugstore
    directly through their contact details found on the Website.
  </p>
  <b>Order Processing</b>
  <p>
    Orders are processed based on the Partner Drugstore's operating hours.
    Orders placed beyond this schedule are processed on the Partner Drugstore's
    next availability. All orders received by the Partner Drugstores are subject
    to order processing by a registered pharmacist employed by the Partner
    drugstore. Orders that require prescription are released to the customer
    upon the discretion of the Partner Drugstore's registered pharmacist after
    confirmation that the customer has a prescription.
  </p>
  <b>Pricing</b>
  <p>
    Retail prices of medicines set by the Partner Drugstores are subject to
    change without prior notice. The Price of medicines stated are inclusive of
    VAT and expressed in Philippine pesos.
  </p>
  <b>Deliveries</b>
  <p>
    Deliveries will be made through the customer's chosen third party delivery
    service. Parmazip will not be held liable for the actions of the delivery
    service.
  </p>
  <b>Subscription</b>
  <p>
    Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis
    ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and
    periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set on either a weekly
    or monthly basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when
    purchasing a Subscription.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew
    under the exact same conditions unless you, the Partner Drugstore, or
    Parmazip, Inc. cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either
    through the subscription page in the Service or by contacting the Parmazip
    customer support team.
  </p>
  <p>
    A valid payment method, including a credit card, is required to process the
    payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Parmazip with accurate and
    complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code,
    telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such
    payment information, you automatically authorize Parmazip to charge all
    Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment
    instruments.
  </p>
  <p>
    Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Parmazip will issue
    an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a
    certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing
    period as indicated on the invoice.
  </p>
  <b>Fee Charges</b>
  <p>
    Parmazip, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the
    Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will
    become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
  </p>
  <p>
    Parmazip will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in
    Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription
    before such change becomes effective.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes
    into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee
    amount.
